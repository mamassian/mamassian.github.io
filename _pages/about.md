How do we perceive the world around us? Research in my group focuses on mid-level vision, the link between the detection of elementary features in an image and the awareness of natural scenes. Current research topics include visual confidence (meta-perception), adaptation at different time-scales, three-dimensional perception (binocular, motion, and pictorial cues), cross-modal integration (vision-audition), temporal dynamics of perception (in particular bistable perception), and probabilistic modelling of perception (Bayesian models).

Confidence Forced-Choice
======
Matlab code to analyse confidence forced-choice data is available here: [CFC](https://github.com/mamassian/cfc).

This code implements the model described in: \
Mamassian, P., & de Gardelle, V. (2022). Modeling perceptual confidence and the confidence forced-choice paradigm. _Psychological Review_, _129_(5), 976â€“998. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1037/rev0000312)
