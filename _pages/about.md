How do we perceive the world around us? Research in my group focuses on mid-level vision, the link between the detection of elementary features in an image and the awareness of natural scenes. Current research topics include visual confidence (meta-perception), adaptation at different time-scales, three-dimensional perception (binocular, motion, and pictorial cues), cross-modal integration (vision-audition), temporal dynamics of perception (in particular bistable perception), and probabilistic modelling of perception (Bayesian models).
